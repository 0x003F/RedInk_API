# RedInk_API

**RedInk_API** is a RESTful API built with FastAPI that provides access to controversial books that have been banned, criticised or censored at some point in history.

## üìö Project Overview

This project began as a personal and academic initiative, aimed at showcasing technical skills in API development, as a commitment to freedom of information and it also serves as a portfolio element.
This application was created to support research, educational access and freedom of information by making historically challenged, controversial or censored books available in digital format. Whether you're a researcher, developer or simply curious, RedInk_API allows you to explore these texts and to integrate them in another application. Also, I will make sure to update the database and add new books from time to time.
